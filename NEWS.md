# [biomartr 1.0.10]()

### Bug fixes
- fixing linking issue in `refseq_genbank_ftp_server_kingdoms_url()`
- remove `NeedsCompilation` flag from DESCRIPTION

# [biomartr 1.0.10](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.10)

### New features

#### GTF support for refseq and genbank
- Since refseq and genbank now supports gtf, we allow it in getGFF/getFFF

#### Generalize and fix paths for NCBI gencode ftp server #116
- Generalized paths to single point functions, for easier fixes in the future.
- Fixed from ftp:// to https:// for NCBI ftp server

- Skip bacteria now propagates also for collections

# [biomartr 1.0.7](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.7)

### New features

#### Generalization of Biomart database access #108
- Generalized biomart database interface (now uses https and port 433) 
- added cache for biomart database overview
- added more unit tests for `listGenomes()` and `biomart()`

### Bug fixes

- fixed `listGenomes()` filter error #107
- Bacteria collection corner case bug fixed #109

# [biomartr 1.0.6](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.6)

### New features

- Some cool new generalization, and check out function `biomartr:::supported_biotypes(db = "refseq")`.
This function will simplify a lot of stuff downstream. (#104)

- Tests are now much quicker to run, because `biomartr::is.genome.available` (which is used basically everywhere) now reads files with data.table instead of reader. (#104)

### Bug fixes

- Fixing bug in `is.genome.available()` where the skip_bacteria argument was not passed on internally to `is.genome.available.refseq.genbank()` (#105)

# [biomartr 1.0.5](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.5)

### Package generalization

Over 5000 lines have been edited, most of them removed (#100), to generalize the package to make it more safe for future
development. This progress is still ongoing.

### New features

- Ensembl genomes is no longer a different database compared to ensembl in biomaRt, since this split is artifical.
It is adviced to use only "ensembl" as db from now on, but "ensemblgenomes" will still work.
- Annotation did mean gff, but it should be both gff and gtf getter, with format specification, this is now fixed and generalized.
- Added in new kingdom for ensembl: protists supportwith correct collection getters
- The retrieval from the `UniProt` database is now updated to the new API/FTP path system. Now users
can retrieve proteomes using the functions `getProteome(db = "uniprot", ...)` and `getProteomeSet(db = "uniprot", ...)` (see #82)
- new function `getBioSet`: Generic Bio data set extractor
- new function `getBio`: A wrapper to all bio getters, selected with 'type' argument
- a new function `getUniProtSTATS()`: Retrieve UniProt Database Information File (STATS)



### Power user cache

The package now supports caching of back end files which used to be saved to /tmp folder (i.e. lost on computer restart).
This make it easy for power users who want higher speed. For more info, see the function ?cachedir_set

### Bug fixes

- Fixed many wrong urls and non working functions, more tests are added to make sure they work. 
- Fixed fungi collection accessor for ensembl

# [biomartr 1.0.4](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.4)

### New Features
- in `getSummaryFile()` all columns of the `assembly_summary.txt` are now specified with names and correct data types (#92)
- all `get*()` functions, the `getKingdomAssemblySummary()`, and `is.genome.available.refseq.genbank()` all receive a new argument `skip_bacteria` which is set to `TRUE` by default. This ensures that the huge dataset file for `bacteria` is not downloaded by default when retrieving summary files from `GenBank`. Users who wish to retrieved data from particular bacteria can actively set `skip_bacteria = TRUE` in all `get*()` functions. 

### Bug Fixes
- whenever the low-level function `getKingdomAssemblySummary()` was called by all get*() functions, due to an error in the `assembly_summary.txt` file for viruses where the total gene count was stored as character and not as integer (as is the case for all other `assembly_summary.txt` files), an error occurred stating that `dplyr::bind_rows()` cannot join column $X35 due to differences in data types. This has now been resolved by parsing the correct data types with `readr`. Many thanks to ... for pointing this out to me. (#92)
- fixing md5checks in all `get*()` functions

# [biomartr 1.0.3](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.3)

- adding [pull request #88](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/pull/88) which fixes issues with `http` to `https` curl requests (Many thanks to @Roleren)

# [biomartr 1.0.2](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.2)

### New Functions

- New function `check_annotation_biomartr()` helps to check whether downloaded GFF or GTF files are corrupt. Find more details [here](https://github.com/lawremi/rtracklayer/issues/15)

- new function `getCollectionSet()` allows users to retrieve a Collection: Genome, Proteome, CDS, RNA, GFF, Repeat Masker, AssemblyStats of multiple species

Example:

```r
# define scientific names of species for which
# collections shall be retrieved
organism_list <- c("Arabidopsis thaliana", 
                   "Arabidopsis lyrata", 
                   "Capsella rubella")
# download the collection of Arabidopsis thaliana from refseq
# and store the corresponding genome file in '_ncbi_downloads/collection'
 getCollectionSet( db       = "refseq", 
             organism = organism_list, 
             path = "set_collections")
```

### New Features 

- the `getGFF()` function receives a new argument `remove_annotation_outliers` to enable users to remove corrupt lines from a GFF file
Example:

```r
Ath_path <- biomartr::getGFF(organism = "Arabidopsis thaliana", remove_annotation_outliers = TRUE)
```

- the `getGFFSet()` function receives a new argument `remove_annotation_outliers` to enable users to remove corrupt lines from a GFF file

- the `getGTF()` function receives a new argument `remove_annotation_outliers` to enable users to remove corrupt lines from a GTF file

- adding a new message system to `biomartr::organismBM()`, `biomartr::organismAttributes()`, and `biomartr::organismFilters()` so that large API queries don't seem so unresponsive

- `getCollection()` receives new arguments `release`, `remove_annotation_outliers`, and `gunzip` that will now be passed on to downstream retrieval functions

- the `getGTF()`, `getGenome()` and `getGenomeSet()` functions receives a new argument `assembly_type = "toplevel"` to enable users to choose between toplevel and primary assembly when using ensembl database. Setting `assembly_type = "primary_assembly"` will save a lot a space on hard drives for people using large ensembl genomes.

- all `get*()` functions with `release` argument now check if the ENSEMBL release is >45 (Many thanks to @Roleren #31 #61) 

- in all `get*()` functions, the `readr::write_tsv(path = )` was exchanged to `readr::write_tsv(file = )`, since the `readr` package version > 1.4.0 is depreciating the `path` argument. 

- `tbl_df()` was deprecated in dplyr 1.0.0.
Please use `tibble::as_tibble()` instead. -> adjusted `organismBM()` accordingly

- `custom_download()`, `getGENOMEREPORT()`, and other download functions now have specified `withr::local_options(timeout = max(30000000, getOption("timeout")))` which extends the default 60sec timeout to 30000000sec



### Bug Fixes

- Fixing bug where genome availability check in `getCollection()` was only performed in `NCBI RefSeq` and not in other databases due to a constant used in `is.genome.available()` rather than a variable (Many thanks to Takahiro Yamada for catching the bug) #53

- fixing an issue that caused the `read_cds()` function to fail in `data.table` mode (Many thanks to Clement Kent) #57

- fixing an `SSL` bug that was found on `Ubuntu 20.04` systems #66 (Many thanks to HÃ¥kon Tjeldnes)

- fixing global variable issue that caused `clean.retrieval()` to fail when no documentation file was in a `meta.retrieval()` folder

- The NCBI recently started adding `NA` values as FTP file paths in their `species summary files` for species without reference genomes. As a result `meta.retrieval()` stopped working, because no FTP paths were found for some species. This issue was now fixed by adding the filter rule `!is.na(ftp_path)` into all `get*()` functions (Many thanks for making me aware of this issue Ashok Kumar Sharma #34 and Dominik Merges #72) 

- Fixing an issue in `custom_download()` where the `method` argument was causing issues when downloading from `https` directed `ftp` sites (Many thanks to @cmatKhan) #76 

- Fixing issue when trying to combine multiple summary-stats files where NA's were present in the list item that was passed along for combination in `meta.retrieval()` #73 (Many thanks to Dominik Merges)

- Fixing a bug in `download.database.all()` where the lack of removing listed file `*-metadata.json` caused corruption of the download process (Many thanks to Jaruwatana Lotharukpong)

biomartr 0.9.2
- minor changes to comply with CRAN policy regarding Internet access failure 
-> Instead of using warnings or error messages, only gentle messages are allowed to be used



biomartr 0.9.0
===========

__Please be aware that as of April 2019, ENSEMBLGENOMES
was retired ([see details here](https://www.ensembl.info/2019/03/08/joint-rest-server-for-ensembl-and-ensembl-genomes-in-ensembl-96/)). Hence, all `biomartr` functions were updated
and won't support data retrieval from `ENSEMBLGENOMES` servers anymore.__

### New Functions

- New function `clean.retrieval()` enables formatting and automatic unzipping of meta.retrieval output (find out more here: https://docs.ropensci.org/biomartr/articles/MetaGenome_Retrieval.html#un-zipping-downloaded-files)
- New function `getGenomeSet()` allows users to easily retrieve genomes of multiple specified species. 
In addition, the genome summary statistics for all retrieved species will be stored as well to provide
users with insights regarding the genome assembly quality of each species. This file can be used as Supplementary Information file
in publications to facilitate reproducible research.
- New function `getProteomeSet()` allows users to easily retrieve proteomes of multiple specified species
- New function `getCDSSet()` allows users to easily retrieve coding sequences of multiple specified species
- New function `getGFFSet()` allows users to easily retrieve GFF annotation files of multiple specified species
- New function `getRNASet()` allows users to easily retrieve RNA sequences of multiple specified species
- New function `summary_genome()` allows users to retrieve summary statistics for a genome assembly file to assess 
the influence of genome assembly qualities when performing comparative genomics tasks
- New function `summary_cds()` allows users to retrieve summary statistics for a coding sequence (CDS) file.
We noticed, that many CDS files stored in NCBI or ENSEMBL databases contain sequences that aren't divisible by 3 (division into codons).
This makes it difficult to divide CDS into codons for e.g. codon alignments or translation into protein sequences. In
addition, some CDS files contain a significant amount of sequences that do not start with AUG (start codon).
This function enables users to quantify how many of these sequences exist in a downloaded CDS file to process
these files according to the analyses at hand.


### New Features of Existing Functions 

- the default value of argument `reference` in `meta.retrieval()` changed from `reference = TRUE` to `reference = FALSE`.
This way all genomes (reference AND non-reference) genomes will be downloaded by default. This is what users seem to prefer.
- `getCollection()` now also retrieves `GTF` files when `db = 'ensembl'`
- `getAssemblyStats()` now also performs md5 checksum test
- all md5 checksum tests now retrieve the new md5checkfile format from NCBI RefSeq and Genbank
- `getGTF()`: users can now specify the NCBI Taxonomy ID or Accession ID in addition to the scientific name in argument 'organism' to retrieve genome assemblies 
- `getGFF()`: users can now specify the NCBI Taxonomy ID or Accession ID for ENSEMBL in addition to the scientific name in argument 'organism' to retrieve genome assemblies 
- `getMarts()` will now throw an error when BioMart servers cannot be reached (#36)
- `getGenome()` now also stores the genome summary statistics (see `?summary_genome()`) for the retrieved species in the `documentation` folder to provide
users with insights regarding the genome assembly quality
- In all get*() functions the default for argument `reference` is now set from `reference = TRUE` to `reference = FALSE` (= new default)
- all `get*()` functions now received a new argument `release` which allows users to retrieve
specific release versions of genomes, proteomes, etc from `ENSEMBL` and `ENSEMBLGENOMES`
- all `get*()` functions received two new arguments `clean_retrieval` and  `gunzip` which
allows users to upzip the downloaded files directly in the `get*()` function call and rename
the file for more convenient downstream analyses


biomartr 0.8.0
===========

### New Functions

- new function `getCollection()` for retrieval of a collection: the genome sequence,
protein sequences, gff files, etc for a particular species

- `is.genome.available()`: argument order was changed from is.genome.available(organism, details, db) to is.genome.available(db, organism, details) to be logically more consistent
with all `get*()` functions
- `meta.retrieval` receives a new argument `restart_at_last` to indicate whether or not the download process when re-running the `meta.retrieval` function
shall pick up at the last species or whether it should crawl through all existing files to check the md5checksum
- `meta.retrieval` now generates an csv overview file in the `doc` folder which stores genome version, date, origin, etc information for
all downloaded organisms and can be directly used as Supplementary Data file in publications to increase computational and biological reproducibility of the genomics study
- `download.database.all()` can now skip already downloaded files and internally removes corrupted files with non-matching md5checksum. Re-downloading of currupted
files and be performed by simply re-running the `download.database.all()` command


biomartr 0.7.0
===========

### Function changes

- the function `meta.retrieval()` will now pick up the download at the organism
where it left off and will report which species have already been retrieved 

- all `get*()` functions and the `meta.retrieval()` function receive a new argument `reference` which allows users to retrieve not-reference or not-representative genome versions when downloading from NCBI RefSeq or NCBI Genbank

biomartr 0.5.1
===========

### Bug fixes

- fixing a bug in `exists.ftp.file()` and `getENSEMBLGENOMES.Seq()` that caused bacterial genome, proteome, etc retrieval to fail due to the wrong construction of a query ftp request https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/issues/7
(Many thanks to @dbsseven)

- fix a major bug in which organisms having no representative genome would generate NULL paths that subsequently crashed the `meta.retrieval()` function when it tried to print out the result paths.

### New Functions

-> In detail, the download process is now adapting to the operating system, e.g. using either `curl` (macOS), `wget` (Linux), or `wininet` (Windows)




### Function changes

- function name `listDatabases()` has been renamed `listNCBIDatabases()`. In `biomartr` version 0.6.0 the function name `listDatabases()` will be depreciated

- `meta.retieval()` and `meta.retieval.all()` now allow the bulk retrieval of GTF files for `type = 'ensembl'` and `type = 'esnemblgenomes'` via `type = "gtf"`. See `getGTF()` for more details.

- `meta.retieval()` and `meta.retieval.all()` now allow the bulk retrieval of RNA files via `type = "rna"`. See `getRNA()` for more details.

- `meta.retieval()` and `meta.retieval.all()` now allow the bulk retrieval of Repeat Masker output files via `type = "rm"`. See `getRepeatMasker()` for more details.

- all `get*()` retrieval functions now skip the download of a particular file if it already exists in the specified file path

- `download.database()` and `download.database.all()` now internally perform md5 check sum checks to make sure that the file download was successful

- `download.database()` and `download.database.all()` now return the file paths of the downloaded file so that it is easier to use these
functions when constructing pipelines, e.g. `download.database() %>% ...` or `download.database.all() %>% ...`.

- `meta.retrieval()` and `meta.retrieval.all()` now return the file paths of the downloaded file so that it is easier to use these
functions when constructing pipelines, e.g. `meta.retrieval() %>% ...` or `meta.retrieval() %>% ...`.

- `getGenome()`, `getProteome()`, `getCDS()`, `getRNA()`, `getGFF()`, and `getAssemblyStats()` now internally perform md5 checksum tests
to make sure that files are retrieved intact.


biomartr 0.4.0
===========

### Bug fixes

- fixing a major bug https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/issues/6 that caused that in all `get*()` (genome, proteome, gff, etc.) and `meta.retrieval*()` functions
 the meta retrieval process errored and terminated whenever NCBI or ENSEMBL didn't
store all types of sequences for a particular organism: genome, proteome, cds, etc. This has been fixed now and function calls
such as `meta.retrieval(kingdom = "bacteria", db = "genbank", type = "proteome")` should work properly now (Thanks to @ARamesh123 for making me aware if this bug). Hence, this bug affected all attempts to download all proteome sequences e.g. for bacteria and viruses, because NCBI does not store genome AND proteome information for all bacterial or viral species. 


### New Functions

- new function `getAssemblyStats()` allows users to retrieve the genome assembly stats file from NCBI RefSeq or Genbank, e.g. ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/405/GCF_000001405.36_GRCh38.p10/GCF_000001405.36_GRCh38.p10_assembly_stats.txt

- new function `read_assemblystats()` allows to import the genome assembly stats file from NCBI RefSeq or Genbank that was retrieved
using the `getAssemblyStats()` function

### Function changes

- `meta.retrieval()` and `meta.retrieval.all()` can now also download genome assembly stats for all selected species

- `meta.retrieval()` receives a new argument `group` that allows users to retrieve species belonging to a subgroup instead of the entire kingdom.
Available groups can be retrieved with `getGroups()`.

- functions `getSubgroups()` and `listSubgroups()` have been removed and their initial functionality
has been merged and integrated into `getGroups()` and `listGroups()`

- `listGroups()` receives a new argument `details` that allows users to retrieve the organism names that belong to the corresponding subgroups

- `getGroups()` is now based on `listGroups()`

- internal function `getGENOMESREPORT()` is now exported and available to the user

- all `organism*()` functions now also support Ensembl Plants, Ensembl Metazoa, Ensembl Protist, and Ensembl Fungi (Thanks for pointing out [Alex Gabel](https://github.com/AlexGa))

- `getMarts()` and `getDatasets()` now also support Ensembl Plants, Ensembl Metazoa, Ensembl Protist, and Ensembl Fungi (Thanks for pointing out [Alex Gabel](https://github.com/AlexGa))


### Vignette updates

- Vignette `Meta-Genome Retrieval` has more examples how to download genomes of species that belong to the same subgroup


biomartr 0.3.0
===========

### Bug fixes

- Fixing a bug https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/issues/2 based on the [readr package](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr) that affected the `getSummaryFile()`, `getKingdomAssemblySummary()`, `getMetaGenomeSummary()`,
`getENSEMBL.Seq()` and `getENSEMBLGENOMES.Seq()` functions causing quoted lines in the `assembly_summary.txt` to be omitted when reading these files. This artefact caused that e.g. instead of information of 80,000 Bacteria genomes only 40,000 (which non-quotations) were read (Thanks to [Xin Wu](https://github.com/alartin)).


biomartr 0.2.1
===========

In this version of `biomartr` the `organism*()` functions were adapted to the new [ENSEMBL 87 release](https://www.ensembl.info/2016/12/08/ensembl-87-has-been-released/)
in which organism name specification in the Biomart description column [was changed](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/issues/1)
from a scientific name convention to a mix of common name and scientific name convention.

- all `organism*()` functions have been adapted to the new ENSEMBL 87 release organism name notation that is used in the Biomart description

- fixing error handling bug that caused commands such as `download.database(db = "nr.27.tar.gz")` to not execute properly

biomartr 0.2.0
===========

In this version, `biomartr` was extended to now retrieve genome, proteome, CDS, GFF and meta-genome data
also from [ENSEMBL](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) and [ENSEMLGENOMES](https://ensemblgenomes.org/).
Furthermore, all NCBI retrieval functions were updated to the new server folder structure standards of NCBI.

- the functions `getGenome()`, `getProteome()`, and `getCDS()` were completely re-written and now use the assembly_summary.txt files
provided by NCBI to retrieve the download path to the corresponding genome. Furthermore, these functions now lost the `kingdom` argument.
Users now only need to specify the organism name and not the kingdom anymore. Furthermore, all `get*` functions now
return the path to the downloaded genome so that this path can be used as input to all `read_*` functions.

- `download_databases()` has been renamed to `download.databases()` to be more consistent with other function notation

- the argument `db_format` was removed from `listDatabases()` and `download.database()` because it was misleading

- the command `listDatabases("all")` now returns all available NCBI databases that can be retrieved with `download.database()`

- `download.database()` now internally checks if input database specified by the user is actually available on NCBI servers

- the documentary file generated by `getGenome()`, `getProteome()`, and `getCDS()` is now extended to store more details about the downloaded genome

- argument `database` in `is.genome.available()` and `listGenomes()` has been renamed to `db` to be consistent with all other sequence retrieval functions

- `is.genome.available()` now also checks availability of organisms in ENSEMBL. See `db = "ensembl"`

- all `read_*` functions now have `format = "fasta"` as default

- the `kingdom` argument in the `listGenomes()` function was renamed to `type`, now allowing users to specify not only specify kingdoms,
but also groups and subgroups. Use: `listGenomes(type = "kingdom")` or `listGenomes(type = "group")` or `listGenomes(type = "subgroup")`

- the `listGenomes()` function receives a new argument `subset` to specify a subset of the selected `type` argument. E.g. `subset = "Eukaryota"` when specifying
`type = "kingdom"`


### Vignette updates

- new Vignette `Meta-Genome Retrieval`
- Update examples and extend `Introduction` Vignette 
- Update examples and extend `Database Retrieval` Vignette 
- Update examples and extend `Sequence Retrieval` Vignette
- Update examples and extend `Functional Annotation` Vignette


biomartr 0.1.0
===========

- fixing a parsing error of the file `ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/assembly_summary.txt`
The problem was that comment lines were introduced and columns couldn't be parsed correctly anymore. This caused that genomes, proteomes, and CDS files could not be downloaded properly. This has been fixed now.

- genomes, proteome, and CDS as well as meta-genomes can now be retrieved
from RefSeq and Genbank (not only RefSeq); only `getCDS()` does not have genebank access,
