\title{Function to quantify the statistical significance of a given pairwise alignment}
\usage{
evalAlignment(seq, subject, sample_size, FUN, ..., fit_distr = "norm",
  gof = FALSE, comp_cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq}{a character vector storing a sequence as string for which random sequences shall be computed.}

\item{subject}{a character vector storing a subject sequence as string to which \code{seq} shall be pairwise aligned.}

\item{sample_size}{a numeric value specifying the number of random sequences that shall be returned.}

\item{FUN}{a pairwise alignment function such as \code{\link[Biostrings]{pairwiseAlignment}} or any other function
that takes sequence arguments as first and second input.}

\item{...}{additional arguments that shall be passed to \code{FUN}.}

\item{fit_distr}{a character string specifying the probability distribution that shall be fitted to the histogram
of scores returned by \code{\link{randSeqDistr}}. See \code{\link[fitdistrplus]{fitdist}} when method = "mme" for details.
A special case is \code{fit_distr} = \code{"simple"}. This way simply the relative frequency of random scores that are greater than
the real alignment score is returned as p-value.}

\item{gof}{a logical value specifying whether or not godness of fit measures shall be printed to the console.}

\item{comp_cores}{a numeric value specifying the number of cores you want to use for multicore processing.}
}
\value{
a p-value quantifying the statistical significance of the pairwise alignment of the input sequences.
}
\description{
This function allows to quantify the statistical significance of a given pairwise alignment
between a query and subject sequence based on a sampled score distribution returned by \code{\link{randSeqDistr}}.
}
\details{
The test statistic is developed using moment matching estimation of a given probability distribution that
is fitted to the alignment score vector returned by \code{\link{randSeqDistr}}. The corresponding distribution
parameters are estimated by the \code{\link[fitdistrplus]{fitdist}} and the p-value quantifying the statistical
significance of the pairwise alignment of the input sequences is returned.

The following distributions can be fitted to the alignment score distribution:

\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{pnorm}}
 \item \code{\link{plnorm}}
 \item \code{\link{ppois}}
 \item \code{\link{pexp}}
 \item \code{\link{pgamma}}
 \item \code{\link{pnbinom}}
 \item \code{\link{pgeom}}
 \item \code{\link{pbeta}}
}

A special case is \code{fit_distr} = \code{"simple"}. This way simply the relative frequency of random scores that are greater than
the real alignment score is returned as p-value.
